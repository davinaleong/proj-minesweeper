### Introduction 🎉

Welcome to Minesweeper! 🏁 This classic computer game is a puzzle that combines strategy 🧠 and memory. Don't worry if it seems challenging at first – we'll break it down into simple steps.

### Game Objective 🎯

Your goal is to find all the hidden mines 💣 on the board without clicking on any of them. You'll use numbers 🔢 as clues to figure out where the mines are.

### Getting Started 🚀

1️⃣ When you start the game, you'll see a grid of blank squares ⬜  
2️⃣ Left-click any square to begin 🖱️  
3️⃣ Tip: It's best to start with a corner or edge square 🎯

### Understanding the Numbers 🔢

After you click a square, you might see a number. Here's what the numbers mean:

- A number tells you how many mines 💣 are touching that square
- For example, if you see a "3️⃣", there are exactly 3 mines in the squares around it
- The mines could be above, below, to the sides, or diagonal to the number

### Basic Moves 🕹️

- **Left-click**: Reveals what's under a square ✅
- **Flag Mode Toggle**: When Flag Mode is ON, tapping a square will place a flag 🚩 instead of revealing it. When OFF, tapping will uncover the square as usual. This makes gameplay smoother, especially on mobile devices.

### Safety Tips ⚠️

1️⃣ Never guess unless you have to ❌  
2️⃣ Take your time – there's no rush ⏳  
3️⃣ If you're unsure about a square, flag it 🚩 and come back later

### Strategy Tips 🧠

1️⃣ Start with the edges and corners 📐  
2️⃣ Look for patterns – if you see a "1️⃣" with only one covered square next to it, that square must contain a mine 💣  
3️⃣ Use flags 🚩 to mark mines – this helps you keep track  
4️⃣ When you find a large empty area, use it as a safe zone to work from 🏞️

### Common Patterns 🔍

1️⃣ If you see a "1️⃣" with only one uncovered square nearby, that square has a mine 💣  
2️⃣ When two "1️⃣"s are next to each other with two covered squares, the mines are diagonal ➕

### What the Colors Mean 🎨

- **Gray squares**: Haven't been clicked yet 🔳
- **White squares**: Safe squares you've revealed ⬜
- **Numbers** have different colors to help you read them better 🌈
- **Red**: Shows mines when the game ends 🔴💣

### When You Win 🏆

✅ You win when you've flagged all mines correctly 🚩  
✅ You don't need to click every safe square ✨  
✅ Just make sure you've found all the mines 🎯

### If You Make a Mistake ❌

- If you click a mine, the game will end 💥
- Don't worry! Just click **"New Game"** 🔄 to start over
- Every game is different, so you get a fresh start 🌟

### Remember 📌

✅ There's no time limit – take as long as you need ⏳  
✅ It's okay to use flags generously 🚩  
✅ Practice makes perfect 💪  
✅ Save your progress often by flagging suspected mines 🏁
