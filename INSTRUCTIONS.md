# How to Play Minesweeper

## Introduction

Welcome to Minesweeper! This classic computer game is a puzzle that combines strategy and memory. Don't worry if it seems challenging at first - we'll break it down into simple steps.

## Game Objective

Your goal is to find all the hidden mines on the board without clicking on any of them. You'll use numbers as clues to figure out where the mines are.

## Getting Started

1. When you start the game, you'll see a grid of blank squares
2. Left-click any square to begin
3. Tip: It's best to start with a corner or edge square

## Understanding the Numbers

After you click a square, you might see a number. Here's what the numbers mean:

- A number tells you how many mines are touching that square
- For example, if you see a "3", there are exactly 3 mines in the squares around it
- The mines could be above, below, to the sides, or diagonal to the number

## Basic Moves

- Left-click: Reveals what's under a square
- Right-click: Places a flag where you think a mine is
- Double right-click: Removes a flag if you change your mind

## Safety Tips

1. Never guess unless you have to
2. Take your time - there's no rush
3. If you're unsure about a square, flag it and come back later

## Strategy Tips

1. Start with the edges and corners
2. Look for patterns - if you see a "1" with only one covered square next to it, that square must contain a mine
3. Use flags to mark mines - this helps you keep track
4. When you find a large empty area, use it as a safe zone to work from

## Common Patterns

1. If you see a "1" with only one uncovered square nearby, that square has a mine
2. When two "1"s are next to each other with two covered squares, the mines are diagonal

## What the Colors Mean

- Gray squares: Haven't been clicked yet
- White squares: Safe squares you've revealed
- Numbers have different colors to help you read them better
- Red: Shows mines when the game ends

## When You Win

- You win when you've flagged all mines correctly
- You don't need to click every safe square
- Just make sure you've found all the mines

## If You Make a Mistake

- If you click a mine, the game will end
- Don't worry! Just click "New Game" to start over
- Every game is different, so you get a fresh start

## Remember

- There's no time limit - take as long as you need
- It's okay to use flags generously
- Practice makes perfect
- Save your progress often by flagging suspected mines
