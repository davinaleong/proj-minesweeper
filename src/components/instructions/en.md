### Introduction

Welcome to Minesweeper! This classic puzzle game combines strategy and memory. If it seems challenging at first, don't worry—we'll break it down into simple steps.

### Game Objective

Your goal is to locate all the hidden mines on the board without clicking on them. Use the numbers as clues to figure out where the mines are.

### Getting Started

1. When you start the game, you'll see a grid of blank squares.
2. Left-click any square to begin.
3. Tip: It's best to start with a corner or edge square.

### Understanding the Numbers

After clicking a square, you may see a number. Here's what they mean:

- A number tells you how many mines are touching that square.
- For example, if you see a "3," there are exactly three mines in the surrounding squares.
- Mines can be above, below, to the sides, or diagonal to the number.

### Basic Moves

- **Left-click**: Reveals what's under a square.
- **Flag Mode Toggle**: When Flag Mode is ON, tapping a square places a flag instead of revealing it. When OFF, tapping uncovers the square as usual. This helps make gameplay smoother, especially on mobile devices.

### Safety Tips

1. Avoid guessing unless necessary.
2. Take your time—there's no rush.
3. If you're unsure about a square, flag it and come back later.

### Strategy Tips

1. Start with the edges and corners.
2. Look for patterns—if you see a "1" with only one covered square next to it, that square must contain a mine.
3. Use flags to mark mines and keep track.
4. When you uncover a large empty area, use it as a safe zone to work from.

### Common Patterns

1. If you see a "1" with only one uncovered square nearby, that square has a mine.
2. When two "1"s are next to each other with two covered squares, the mines are likely diagonal.

### What the Colors Mean

- **Gray squares**: Haven't been clicked yet.
- **White squares**: Safe squares you've revealed.
- **Numbers**: Displayed in different colors to make them easier to read.
- **Red**: Indicates mines when the game ends.

### Winning the Game

- You win when you've correctly flagged all the mines.
- You don't need to click every safe square.
- Just ensure all mines have been found.

### If You Click a Mine

- The game will end immediately.
- Don't worry! Click **"New Game"** to start over.
- Every game is different, so you get a fresh start each time.

### Final Tips

- There's no time limit—take as long as you need.
- Use flags generously to help track potential mines.
- Practice makes perfect!
- If you're unsure, ask a friend or family member to help.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
